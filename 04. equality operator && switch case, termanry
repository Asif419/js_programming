== will convert type to compare 

const age = 18;
const ageCheck = age == 18;
console.log(ageCheck); // output: true

const age = '18';
const ageCheck = age === 18;
console.log(ageCheck); // output: false
//because string 18 can't compared by number 18 with === operator, but

const age = '18';
const ageCheck = age == 18;
console.log(ageCheck); // output: true
//this is true because string 18 is converted to number by == operator


-------------------
switch case example:

const day = prompt("Enter a day");

switch (day) {
  case "Sunday":
    console.log("Weekend");
    break;
  case "Monday":
    console.log("Week Start");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Sorry! type correctly");
}

---------------

statement vs expression

statement means full sentence like if-else statement
or ending with ; is statement

const sentence = "Hello world";
//here hello world is expression and full sentence is statement

== will convert type to compare 

const age = 18;
const ageCheck = age == 18;
console.log(ageCheck); // output: true

const age = '18';
const ageCheck = age === 18;
console.log(ageCheck); // output: false
//because string 18 can't compared by number 18 with === operator, but

const age = '18';
const ageCheck = age == 18;
console.log(ageCheck); // output: true
//this is true because string 18 is converted to number by == operator
